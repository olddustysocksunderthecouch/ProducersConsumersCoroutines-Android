# What's this about?
This repo contains code that was completed as part of the interview process for a certain company. 

# Project outline

Create a simple Android-App which shows a list and two buttons below the list ordered horizontal.
Clicking the left button creates a new producer.
Clicking the right button creates a new consumer.

A producer adds every 3 seconds a new item to the list.
A consumer removes every 4 seconds an item from the list.
A created producer/consumer will never be removed and will do its job forever.

The user can create producer or consumer how often he wants by clicking the specified buttons.

Use suitable ui elements to display the Buttons and List.

# Note

More comments where added than usual so that a reader, who's unfamiliar with coroutines, may understand 
how the code works.
